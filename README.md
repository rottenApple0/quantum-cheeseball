# Quantum Cheeseball

Quantum Cheeseball is a procedural map generation tool designed for games, worldbuilding, and experimentation.  
It generates random 2D grids using several algorithms like cellular automata, Perlin noise, and drunkard walk.

This project was built as a learning exercise to master GitHub, Git workflows.
